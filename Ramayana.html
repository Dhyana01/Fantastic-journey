Rama. Who was the seventh avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu. He is the central figure of the Hindu epic Ramayana, which is the principal narration of the events connected to his incarnation on Earth, his ideas and his greatness. He was the eldest son of King-
Dashratha-the ruler of Kosala Kingdom. Rama's life and journey is one of adherence to dharma despite harsh tests and obstacles and many pains of life and time.
