Deforestration are caused due to industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, agricultural practices, improper waste disposal, and deforestation. 
There are different types of pollution:

Air Pollution:

Burning fossil fuels:
Combustion of coal, oil, and gas in power plants, vehicles, and industries releases harmful gases and particulate matter. 

Industrial emissions:
Factories and manufacturing processes release various pollutants into the air. 

Vehicle exhaust:
Emissions from cars, trucks, and other vehicles contribute significantly to air pollution.

Deforestation:
Reduces the amount of carbon dioxide being absorbed by trees and releases stored carbon into the atmosphere. 

Wildfires:
Release smoke and particulate matter into the atmosphere. 

Natural sources:
Volcanic eruptions, dust storms, and decaying vegetation can also contribute to air pollution.
 
Household sources:
Burning wood, and use of volatile organic compounds in cleaning products can also contribute.
 
Water Pollution:


Industrial effluents:
Wastewater from factories containing heavy metals and chemicals is often discharged into water bodies.

Sewage and wastewater:
Untreated sewage and wastewater from households and businesses can contaminate water sources.

Oil spills:
Accidental spills of oil and other petroleum products can severely pollute oceans and coastal areas.

Natural causes:
Eutrophication (excess nutrients in water bodies) can also lead to water pollution. 

Soil Pollution:
Industrial waste: Disposal of industrial waste, including heavy metals and chemicals, can contaminate soil. 

Agricultural activities: 
Pesticides, fertilizers, and animal waste can contaminate soil. 

Improper waste disposal: Landfills and open dumping of garbage can leach pollutants into the soil. 

Consequences:
Pollution has severe consequences for human health and the environment, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, ecosystem damage, and climate change.
