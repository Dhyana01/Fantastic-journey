<p><pre>🥕 The Vegetarian and Vegan Delights of the Carnival ✨
Our commitment is to provide deeply satisfying and imaginative plant-based options at every major food station:

🌟 Featured Vegan & Vegetarian Spectacles
The Spice Route Skewers (Plant-Based Option):

The Sultan's Tofu: Large cubes of firm, pressed tofu and chunky vegetables (peppers, zucchini, red onion) marinated overnight in a rich, smoky harissa and preserved lemon paste. They are flash-grilled to achieve a crispy exterior and served with a cooling, mint-infused dipping sauce.

Aetherial Doughnuts (Vegan Selection):

The Celestial Rings: A lighter, yeast-risen doughnut made with a plant-based batter. These are often flavored with seasonal fruits and spices, such as Cardamom-Orange Blossom or a rich Blueberry-Basil. They are dusted with natural fruit powders for vibrant color.

The Fortune Teller's Fryery (Vegan Favorite):

The Mystic Mushroom Fries: Crispy-fried king oyster mushroom "steaks" cut into thick, satisfying strips, resembling the texture of meat. They are seasoned with a bold Smoked Paprika and Rosemary blend and served with a side of creamy, homemade Avocado-Lime Crema (vegan).

The Sugar Sculpture Stand (Naturally Vegan Options):

Many of our famous rock candy gems, candied fruits, and caramelized apples are naturally vegan. The specialty is the "Emerald Apple," a large granny smith apple dipped in a smooth, vibrant green caramel infused with Matcha Green Tea, often topped with toasted coconut flakes.

🌿 Hearty & Hidden Gems
Beyond the main items, we ensure small, delicious vegan bites are everywhere:

Savory Empanadas: Handheld pockets filled with a rich mixture of black beans, corn, roasted sweet potato, and chipotle spices. Perfect for eating while wandering.

Gourmet Popcorn Cart: Classic popcorn elevated with exotic, non-dairy flavors like Curry and Sea Salt or Nutritional Yeast and Garlic Powder ("Cheesy" flavor).

Our vegan and vegetarian food is not merely an alternative; it's a vibrant, essential element of the Carnival of Wonders' grand feast!</pre></p></body></html>
